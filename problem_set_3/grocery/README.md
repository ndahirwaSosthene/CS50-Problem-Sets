# Grocery List

grocery.py is a program for building a grocery list that counts and sorts items.

The script prompts the user to enter grocery items one per line, case-insensitively, until the user presses control-d (EOF).
It then prints the grocery list in all uppercase, sorted alphabetically, and prefixes each item with the number of times it was entered.

Run with **python grocery.py**, enter your items, and press control-d to see your organized list.
Created for a CS50 exercise on dictionaries, input handling, and sorting.
