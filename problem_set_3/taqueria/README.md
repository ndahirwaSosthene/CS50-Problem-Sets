# Felipe's Taqueria

taqueria.py is a program that lets users place an order from Felipeâ€™s Taqueria menu and keeps a running total.

The script prompts the user to enter menu items one per line (case-insensitive), until control-d (EOF) is pressed.
After each valid item, it displays the updated total cost, formatted as $X.XX. Invalid items are ignored.

Menu items and prices include:

Baja Taco: $4.25

Burrito: $7.50

Bowl: $8.50

Nachos: $11.00

Quesadilla: $8.50

Super Burrito: $8.50

Super Quesadilla: $9.50

Taco: $3.00

Tortilla Salad: $8.00

Run with **python taqueria.py**, enter your items, and press control-d to finish and see your total.
Created for a CS50 exercise on dictionaries, input handling, and running totals.
