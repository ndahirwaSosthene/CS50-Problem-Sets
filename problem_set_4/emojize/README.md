# Emojize

emojize.py is a program that converts emoji codes and aliases in text to their corresponding emoji characters.

The script prompts the user to enter a string containing emoji codes (like :thumbs_up: or :thumbsup:) and outputs the same string with all recognized codes and aliases replaced by actual emoji.

This program uses the emoji Python module.
Install it first with:

 # pip install emoji

Run with **python emojize.py**, enter your text with emoji codes, and see them instantly converted!
