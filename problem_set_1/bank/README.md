# Home Federal Savings Bank

bank.py is a fun script inspired by a Seinfeld episode about greetings at the bank.

The program prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello” (case-insensitive, ignoring leading spaces), it outputs $0.
If it starts with “h” (but not “hello”), it outputs $20.
For any other greeting, it outputs $100.

Run with **python bank.py** and enter your greeting to see your “reward”!
Created for a CS50 exercise on string methods and conditional logic.
