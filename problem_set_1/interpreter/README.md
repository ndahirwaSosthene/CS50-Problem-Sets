# Math Interpreter

interpreter.py is a simple math interpreter that evaluates basic arithmetic expressions from user input.

The program prompts the user to enter an expression in the form x y z (e.g., 3 * 4), where x and z are integers and y is one of +, -, *, or /.
It calculates and prints the result as a floating-point number, formatted to one decimal place.

Supported operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Run with **python interpreter.py** and enter your arithmetic expression to see the result.
