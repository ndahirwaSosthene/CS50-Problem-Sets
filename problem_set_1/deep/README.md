# Deep Thought

deep.py is a playful program inspired by The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy.

The script prompts the user for the "Answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."
If the user enters 42, forty-two, or forty two (case-insensitive), it prints Yes; otherwise, it prints No.

Run with **python deep.py** and see if you know the answer to life, the universe, and everything!
Created for a CS50 exercise on string comparison and user input.
