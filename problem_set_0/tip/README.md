# Tip Calculator

tip.py is a simple tip calculator for restaurant meals, created for a CS50 exercise.

The program prompts the user to enter the meal cost (e.g., $50.00) and the tip percentage (e.g., 15%).
It then calculates and prints the tip amount to two decimal places.

The script includes functions to convert the meal cost (removing $ and converting to float) and the tip percentage (removing % and converting to a decimal float).

Run with python tip.py and follow the prompts to quickly determine your tip!
