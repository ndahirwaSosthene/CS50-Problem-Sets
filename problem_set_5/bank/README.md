# Back to the bank

This program determines a dollar amount based on a greeting string:

## Returns 0 if the greeting starts with "hello" (case-insensitive)

## Returns 20 if it starts with "h" but not "hello"

## Returns 100 otherwise

The function value(greeting) takes a string and returns the corresponding integer.
Only main() prints output and runs if the script is executed directly.

Run with:
**python bank.py**
**test_bank.py**
This file contains multiple test functions beginning with test_ to thoroughly test your value function.

Run tests with:
**pytest test_bank.py**
This setup promotes modular code and effective testing of your greeting value calculator.
