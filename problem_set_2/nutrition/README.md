# Nutrition Facts

nutrition.py is a simple script that displays the calorie content of the 20 most commonly consumed raw fruits in the U.S., based on FDA data.

The program prompts the user to enter the name of a fruit (case-insensitive, e.g., strawberries).
If the fruit is in the FDAâ€™s list, it outputs the number of calories in one portion; otherwise, it does nothing.

The script uses a dictionary to map fruit names to their calorie values for efficient lookup.

Run with **python nutrition.py** and enter a fruit name to see its calorie content.
Created for a CS50 exercise on dictionaries and user input.
