# Just Setting Up my Twitter

twttr.py is a program that shortens text by omitting all vowels, inspired by how Twitter was originally called "twttr."

The script prompts the user to enter a string of text and then outputs the same text with all vowels (A, E, I, O, U, both uppercase and lowercase) removed.

Run with **python twttr.py** and enter your text to see the vowel-free version.
Created for a CS50 exercise on string iteration and manipulation.
