# camelCase

camel.py is a simple script that converts variable names from camel case to Pythonâ€™s recommended snake case.

The program prompts the user to enter a variable name in camel case (e.g., preferredFirstName).
It outputs the equivalent name in snake case (e.g., preferred_first_name), with all letters in lowercase and words separated by underscores.

Run with **python camel.py** and enter a camel case variable name to see its snake case version.
