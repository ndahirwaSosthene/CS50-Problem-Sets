# Vanity Plates

plates.py is a program that checks if a Massachusetts vanity license plate meets all official requirements.

The script prompts the user to enter a plate and outputs Valid if it meets these rules, or Invalid otherwise:

The plate must start with at least two letters.

It must be 2â€“6 characters long (letters or numbers only).

Numbers, if present, must be at the end (not in the middle), and the first number cannot be 0.

No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.

Run with **python plates.py** and enter a plate to check its validity.
Created for a CS50 exercise on string methods and validation logic.
